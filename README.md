# ScratchNN
Building a two-layer deep neural network from scratch using only Python and NumPy â€” no external libraries â€” to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
I built this project as a stepping stone. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, I wanted to implement core concepts manually to solidify my foundation and understanding of deep learning before progressing into more complex projects.

## ðŸ“Š Loading the Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits.
Each example is a 28Ã—28 grayscale image, where each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255, representing pixel intensity.
The dataset also includes corresponding digit labels (0â€“9) for each image.
```python 
(x, y), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```
x shape: (60000, 28, 28)
y shape: (60000,) 
x_test shape: (10000, 28, 28)
y_test shape: (10000,) 

## Data Preprocessing 
For data preprocessing, I wanted to shuffle the data and then split it up into training and validation. 
I reshaped the input matrix, x into a 2D array where each row would represent a training example. Then I reshaped the label array from a flat array of labels into a 2D column vector. I then appended the label values to each row (training examples) with h stack. Then, I shuffled the data to ensure randomness. 
```python 
x_flat = x.reshape((x.shape[0], -1))  / 255.0
y = y.reshape(-1, 1) 
data = np.hstack((y, x_flat)) 
np.random.shuffle(data)

x_test_flat = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], -1) / 255.0
y_test = y_test.reshape(-1, 1)
test_data = np.hstack((y_test, x_test_flat))
np.random.shuffle(test_data)
```
Then I took the first 1000 rows (1000 training examples) to be my validation set, and transposed it such that each column is a training example. Since the first row would now be the labels, I spliced the matrix and stored the first row in Y_validation as a 1D array, and kept the remaining matrix in X_validation.
I repeated the same process for the remaining rows for my training set.
```python 
m, n = data.shape
data_validation = data[0: 1000].T
Y_validation = data_validation[0]
X_validation = data_validation[1: n]

data_train = data[1000: m].T
Y_train = data_train[0]
X_train = data_train[1: n] # (784, 59000) because we set aside 1000 for validation

```
