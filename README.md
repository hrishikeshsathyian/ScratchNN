# ScratchNN
Building a Neural Network using only Numpy and Python, no other libraries.


## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
I built this neural network project as a stepping stone into future ML projects. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks like 
TensorFlow or PyTorch, I wanted implement core concepts manually to solidify my foundation before moving into bigger projects.
