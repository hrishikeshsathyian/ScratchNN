# ScratchNN
Building a two-layer deep neural network from scratch using only Python and NumPy â€” no external libraries â€” to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
I built this project as a stepping stone. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, I wanted to implement core concepts manually to solidify my foundation and understanding of deep learning before progressing into more complex projects.

## ðŸ“Š Loading the Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits.
Each example is a 28Ã—28 grayscale image, where each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255, representing pixel intensity.
The dataset also includes corresponding digit labels (0â€“9) for each image.
